I"P<p>There are two topic about personal digital figure. One is back-ups of your past digital figure, another is syncing your digital figure.</p>

<h3 id="past-digital-back-ups">Past digital Back-ups</h3>

<p>There are some social platform that I won’t use them anymore. So my idea is transferring these back-ups and transfer them into Day-One</p>

<ol>
  <li>QQ/ Douban/ Weibo history messages exist some mature back-up tool, and we will process some file format transfer work later.</li>
  <li>Blued, Aloha, Wechat and “你的日记” have no automatic tool. they can only be transferred manually.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sync-your-figure">Sync your figure.</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Instagram and Weibo have some connection with <strong>IFTTT</strong>, so every blog from now on will have a copy in Day-One. But the picture in Instagram will show in 640x640 through IFTTT, meanwhile shows 1080x1080 in Day-One in-app subscription.</li>
  <li>As for the specific Day-One Journey, you should use <strong><em>Standard</em></strong> Encryption instead of  <strong><em>End-to-End</em></strong> Encryption.</li>
</ol>
