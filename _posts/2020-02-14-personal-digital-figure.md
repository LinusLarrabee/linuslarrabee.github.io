There are two topic about personal digital figure. One is back-ups of your past digital figure, another is syncing your digital figure.

### Past digital Back-ups

There are some social platform that I won't use them anymore. So my idea is transferring these back-ups and transfer them into Day-One

1. QQ/ Douban/ Weibo history messages exist some mature back-up tool, and we will process some file format transfer work later.
2. Blued, Aloha, Wechat and "你的日记" have no automatic tool. they can only be transferred manually.

### Sync your figure.

1. Instagram and Weibo have some connection with **IFTTT**, so every blog from now on will have a copy in Day-One. But the picture in Instagram will show in 640x640 through IFTTT, meanwhile shows 1080x1080 in Day-One in-app subscription.
2. As for the specific Day-One Journey, you should use ***Standard*** Encryption instead of  ***End-to-End*** Encryption.
